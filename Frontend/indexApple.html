                        from November 24, 2023, to November 27, 2023, at a Qualifying Location. Offer subject to
                        availability. While
                        supplies last. Qualifying purchasers can receive a discount equal to the value of the Promotion
                        Product (depending on their purchase) off the price of the Eligible Product,
                        but will be charged for all items in their cart. Important notice regarding the checkout receipt
                        and monthly statement for Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) purchases
                        with this promotion: A purchase of an Eligible Product made when selecting ACMI (a 0% APR
                        payment option available only in the U.S.) as the payment type at checkout will
                        receive an instant credit equal to the cost of the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) deducted
                        from the price of the Eligible Product at the time of purchase. You will be
                        charged one ACMI installment plan for the Eligible Product discounted by the instant credit. The
                        value of the Promotion Product (i.e., the value of the Apple Gift Card) will
                        also be charged in a separate second ACMI installment plan for the same number of months as the
                        discounted Eligible Product. The total combined amount charged over the
                        2 separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible
                        Product. Separately, you will receive and be charged for the Promotion Product
                        (Apple Gift Card) in the amount of the applicable instant credit. ACMI is a 0% APR payment
                        option that is only available if you select it at checkout in the U.S. for eligible
                        Apple products purchased at Apple Store locations, apple.com, the Apple Store app, or by calling
                        1-800-MY-APPLE, and is subject to credit approval and credit limit. See
                        support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for more information about eligible products. APR ranges may vary
                        based on when you accepted an Apple Card. Cardholders who accept an
                        Apple Card on and/or after August 10, 2023: Variable APRs for Apple Card, other than ACMI, range
                        from 19.24% to 29.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of August 10,
                        2023. Existing cardholders: See your Customer Agreement for applicable rates and fee. If you buy
                        an ACMI-eligible product by choosing to pay in full with Apple Card
                        (instead of using ACMI), that purchase is subject to the Apple Card variable APR, not 0% APR.
                        Taxes and shipping on ACMI purchases are subject to the variable APR, not 0%
                        APR. You’ll need to select AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon as your carrier when you check out. An
                        iPhone purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at
                        any time. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the following special stores: Apple
                        Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase
                        Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government, and Veterans and Military Purchase
                        Programs, or on refurbished devices. The last month’s payment for each
                        product will be the product’s purchase price, less all other payments at the monthly payment
                        amount. ACMI financing is subject to change at any time for any reason,
                        including but not limited to, installment term lengths and eligible products. See
                        support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for information about upcoming changes to ACMI financing.
